NVSL Library Management notes, 020515 Steve Deiss:

Starting with 5 FPX files of 6 intended (NVSL-TH-ICs.fpx not started yet)
These files have the parts needed for the NVSL Trinket Pro with power breakout options.
NVSL-SMD-Connectors
NVSL-SMD-ICs
NVSL-SMD-passives
NVSL-TH-Connectors
NVSL-TH-Passives

NVSL-Hand-Solder-UserPreferences was used with each to build the .lbr files.  Internal IPC defaults were used with these.  The UserPreferences file eliminated the pin 1 dot everywhere, and otherwise used the maximal IPC settings.  We may need to tune this over time to get better hand soldering yield.

062515:  Rebuilt all decals with PCBLE 2015.15.7  Using default Nominal settings with pin 1 marked.
000215:  Cleaned up attributes, and symbols for Koala and merged NVSL lib into it.  Back annotated all Koala changes to NVSL lib.
