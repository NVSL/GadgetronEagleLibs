TYPES of Licenses
Two types of licenses are available for this product, Single User and Network. the type of license purchased is specified on the invoice or receipt. You assume full responsibility for the safekeeping of the license/registration code you are provided for either type of license. Software evaluation may only be done for 30 days by any person or company, any action to extend this time, such as but not limited to reinstalling, changing computers, using multiple drives, etc., is prohibited.

Single User - This license grants use of the Software on one computer OTHER than a server, shared drive, or other medium that shares connection with other computers. When the Software is used under this license, it must be used locally.

Network - The Network License grants the right to install and use the Software on a local company network. For example, a 10-user Network License grants use of the Software on 10 simltaneous computers, anywhere on the company network. It is the users' responsibility to ensure the license/software is allowed/restricted to specific user(s). The Network License is available on USB Key, and the number of seats/licenses purchased may be checked in/out over a local network.

Activation Types, Limits, and Replacements
::USB Key - Both Single User and Network USB Keys are perpetual and permanent - they only need to be activated one time. This perpetual USB Key-based license is the default license priced into the PCB Library Expert. Damaged USB Keys may be replaced by PCBL at cost (varies based on type of license), plus an administrative fee and shipping/handling, provided the damaged USB Key is sent to PCBL and it's authenticity can be verified. Lost or stolen keys will not be replaced and the license must be repurchased. It is recommended that customers add this license to the business insurance policy they have to ensure it is covered. PCBL can issue a 30-day temporary license while the insurance process covers for the repurchase of the new license(s).

::Non-USB Key - Starting with v2013, the software will allow license activation with HASP SL (non-USB version of HASP). The HASP SL license will expire and you will need to contact PCBL to "REFRESH" it every 12 months. There will be no cost of refreshing if it is in conjunction with an upgrade purchase, or for the same HASP SL license. If the license is installed on a new computer or the hard drive is reformatted and/or a new activation is required, the "REPLACEMENT" license will be subject to an administrative cost, and require both customer and PCBL take steps to terminate all previously issued license(s)/activation(s) that are being replaced. If you do not upgrade the software license and want to refresh an older license (for example refreshing a 2013 license in 2014 without upgrading), the REFRESH will be subject to a cost equal to approximately 10% the cost of the license at that time.
